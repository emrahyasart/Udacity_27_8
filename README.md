# Udacity_27_8

the longest_repetition procedure takes as input a list, and returns the element in the list that has the most consecutive repetitions. 
If there are multiple elements that have the same number of longest repetitions, the result is the one that appears first. If the input list is empty it returns None. This is possible with the codes in Udacity_27_8. However if the list element is a list or nested list, the result is a type object error. That is why l wrote Udacity_27_8.
